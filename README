VASIC Data Analysis is a data processing script utilizing the MATLAB 
environment for processing and visualizing data acquired from a VASIC device. 
This program reads all properly formatted *.csv files from a single directory
and applies various filters to the data before generating a final output 
folder containing a collection of descriptive statistics. 

There are 3 levels of filtering applied to the data in sequence and controlled 
by 3 input parameters the user is prompted for at program startup: 
1. 	Filtering readings without a minimum of X (default 2) data points 
2. 	Filtering data points where the summation of both platforms is outside of 
	Â± X% (default 25%) of the calculated bodyweight
3. 	Filtering weight readings where the weight measurement on
	either platform is <X% (default 3%) of the calculated bodyweight 

The final output folder name is generated from the dates of the files processed
and is formatted as follows: Results_[Start_<STARTDATE>_End_<ENDDATE>] 
with <STARTDATE> and <ENDDATE> being replaced by the appropriate start and end 
dates of the files processed. 

The final output folder top level structure and descriptions are as follows:
1. 	Access_Stats: directory containing summary statistics of the rodents' 
	average access times and number of access events
2.	Figures: directory containing images depicting individual data files' time
	course summaries and weight bias histograms
3.	LR_Differences: a directory containing absolute weight bias summary 
	statistics for raw data and each level of filtering in sequence 
	(ie. Filter3 data has been filtered by Filter1, Filter2, and Filter3).
	Also contains summary statistic files for the number of incidents where 
	Filter3 has eliminated data points (total number of data points filtered). 
4.	Normalized_LR_Differences: a directory containing weight bias summary 
	statistics normalized to the rodents' calculated bodyweight for raw data 
	and each level of filtering in sequence 
	(ie. Filter3 data has been filtered	by Filter1, Filter2, and Filter3).
5.	Errors.txt: a text file listing any files in which an error occurred 
	during data processing. 
6.	Log.txt: a text file listing a summary of the dates processed and the 
	files read. 
7.	Settings.txt: a text file listing the input parameters used to generate 
	the processed data files. 
8.	Weights.csv: a *.csv file listing the calculated bodyweight of each 
	rodent on each day.
